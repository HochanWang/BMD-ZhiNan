指南里的内容，上下辑两部分：其中上辑全部学校以内，有关选课，也有关于第一年以外的实习与毕设；下辑则更多是生活方面，办银行卡，去医院，超市优惠之类。

The content of this guide is divided into two parts:  The former part delves solely into university life, discussing topics such as course selection, along with internships and final projects that beyond the first year. The latter part primarily encompasses everyday life in Delft, like opening a bank account, going to the hospital, supermarket bonus etc.
